README for AVL eispack directory

AVL uses the eispack library to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
for the AVL model dynamics system.  This requires the xxx.mass data and
one or more converged operating points.

AVL uses the eispack RG routine (which in turn calls many of the underlying
eispack functions and subroutines.

*************************************************************************
Note that the eispack routines are already in double precision so that
eispack does not need to be compiled separately for double precision AVL.
